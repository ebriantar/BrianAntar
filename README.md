In the following repository I share with you the projects that introduced me into the data science world. The first one "Properati_Project" turns out to be my first experience in the area of exploratory analysis and data transformation, as well as my first hands on training with pedictive machine learning models. In second place you will find "BsAs_Traffic_Flow_Analysis", the objective of this project was to learn about the analysis and forecast of time series.
